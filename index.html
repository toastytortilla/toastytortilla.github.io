        <p class="contents"> It's been almost a full year since I made the decision to pursue computer science. 
            I'm still not very far along, but I've been making progress nonetheless. Some 
            progress is still progess, right? That's what they say, anyway. I'm hoping to turn this
             into a career over the next year. In order to do that, 
             I must work with intention and intensity. By the end of the summer I plan to have a general direction in mind. Front end? SWE? Project Manager? UI/UX designer? I don't know, but I do aim to complete CS50x and have a few small projects built. I'm hoping that I will be able to glean a better idea of where I want to go once I get through that. Today, I made a blog, what's up for tomorrow? <br><br><a href="#second-post">Let's find out.</a></p>
